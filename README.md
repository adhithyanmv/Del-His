Aaah Yes! Another day, gotta wake up, pick your brush, brush your teeth, eat breakfast, getting ready and most importantly clear the browser history ðŸ¦„.
well yeah i got you, this tool can help you with that, just type `dltHisWin.py -add` for adding the websites that you want to clear all time.
you dont have to give the exact url like `https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-get-a-girlfriend-in-4-steps` instead you can just give `quora` its that simple.
once you gave the urls, you dont have to do that again all time unless you want to add something more and to run this tool, just type `dltHisWin.py`.
This will only works on windows chrome atleast for now and Hopefully by the next update this tool can be used in any platform
